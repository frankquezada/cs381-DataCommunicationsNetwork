# VERY primitive file transfer. There is no protocol--when the
# server receives a connection request it immediately begins saving
# the data into a file. When data stop arriving or the connection
# times out, the file is closed and listening resumes.
# As a precaution, this can handle at most three file transfers before
# quitting. As a further precaution, no more than 10K bytes are allowed
# in any file.
